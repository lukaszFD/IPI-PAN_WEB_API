## Project

It is a project carried out at the postgraduate studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences in the field of: "Programming on the .NET platform". This system will be an interface of web communication with the repository of accounts storing information about : systems, servers and accesses. It will be a bridge between other systems and will only manage this information. In this project I will use the latest technologies available in Microsoft.
